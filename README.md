Are you looking for more after a quick introduction or did you miss my talk? Here I will show you the improvements I’ve made to the work in Wilde et al (2022) and lensfindery-mcLensFinderFace.



Previously I have trained a CNN (OU-200) to identify strong gravitational lenses in simulated Euclid data. I have investigated what features OU-200 associated with gravitational lensing. I have found that blue ring like features are detected as gravitational lenses by OU-200. I have applied OU-200 to HST data, the majority of images classified as ‘lens’ with high confidence were image artifacts.  
This is of course not the ideal outcome.
